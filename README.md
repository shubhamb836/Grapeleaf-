This repository contains code for building a Grape Leaf Disease Detection. The project aims to develop a model capable of accurately identifying disease on grape leaf.

Dataset:
The dataset contaion images of Grape leaf diseses named Grape Black_rot, Grape Esca_(Black Measles), Grape Leaf blight (Isariopsis Leaf_Spot), yelllow, and Grape healthy
